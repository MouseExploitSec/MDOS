![Screenshot_1](https://github.com/MouseExploitSec/MDOS/blob/main/mdos.png)

> a high-frequency HTTP request sending tool designed for testing and suppression purposes. It can send random HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specified target URLs

## List of Features Already Added
[+] HTTP Flood (DDoS): Sends a large number of HTTP requests to the target to overwhelm the server.
[+] Randomized User-Agent: Each request uses a different User-Agent to mimic traffic from various devices.
[+] Dynamic Path Generation: Generates random paths for each request to make detection harder.
[+] Randomized Query Parameters: Adds random query parameters to each request.
[+] Multi-Threading: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor to send requests simultaneously with adjustable thread count.
[+] Request Rate Control: Controls the number of requests per second to avoid being blocked by firewalls or security systems.
[+] IP Spoofing: Uses the `X-Forwarded-For` header with random IPs to hide the original identity.
[+] Traffic Monitoring: Displays real-time statistics like total requests and requests per second.
[+] Error Handling: Handles errors such as timeouts, connection errors, and invalid URLs more effectively.
[+] Custom Headers: Adds custom headers to make requests appear more natural.
[+] Logging System: Logs all attack activities into a file (`http_flood.log`) for further analysis.
[+] Colorful Output: Uses the `colorama` library to display colored output in the terminal.
[+] Argument Parsing: Uses `argparse` to accept command-line inputs like target URLs, thread count, and request rate.
